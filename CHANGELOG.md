## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **LLM Provider Infrastructure Layer**: Moved `DynamicLlmProvider` and `BackgroundLlmProvider` from `api-server/main.rs` to `libs/infrastructure/src/llm/dynamic.rs`, making them reusable across all crates.
- **Centralized Configuration (`AiomeConfig`)**: Introduced `libs/shared/src/config.rs` with `AiomeConfig` struct that consolidates all environment variable loading (DB path, LLM hosts/models, API keys, CORS origins, Hub URLs) into a single source of truth.
- **Immune System Hardening**: Expanded baseline threat detection signatures from 6 to 14 patterns, including reverse shells (`nc -e`), environment variable exfiltration (`API_KEY` patterns), SQL injection (`DROP TABLE`), and Python socket-based attacks.
- **Streaming LLM Support**: Added `tokio-stream` dependency to infrastructure layer, enabling `stream_complete()` for real-time token-by-token LLM responses via SSE.
- **Embedding Provider Fallback**: `BackgroundLlmProvider` now implements `EmbeddingProvider` trait with automatic fallback: Ruri → Gemini → Ollama.

### Changed
- **Panic-Free Startup**: Replaced all `expect()` / `unwrap()` calls in `api-server/main.rs` startup path with `unwrap_or_else` + `error!` + `std::process::exit(1)` for graceful error reporting.
- **CORS Configuration**: Migrated from hardcoded origin strings to `AiomeConfig.allowed_origins`, loaded dynamically from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var.
- **Hub URL Resolution**: `SAMSARA_HUB_REST` and `SAMSARA_HUB_WS` now resolved from `AiomeConfig` instead of scattered `env::var()` calls.
- **Federation Secret**: `FEDERATION_SECRET` no longer panics when unset; instead logs a warning and defaults to empty string.
- **DB Migration Logging**: Replaced silent `.ok()` error suppression in `migrations.rs` with `info!` logging for index creation and ALTER TABLE operations.
- **Server Bind Error**: TCP listener bind failure now shows the actual address and exits gracefully instead of panicking.
- **API Server Modularization**: Extracted massive monolithic routing into `routes/` (karma, agent, biome, expression, general) to prepare for Biome integration.
- **Samsara Engine (Evolution)**: AI self-leveling based on cumulative Technical Karma weights (`do_sync_samsara_level`).
- **Meta-Control Security**: Introduced `ConstitutionalValidator` trait for Heterogeneous Dual-LLM validation. The `SoulMutator` now securely verifies `SOUL.md` mutations using a prosecutor LLM.
- **Management Console (Dashboard v2)**: Launched a Tauri React-based desktop shell (`apps/management-console`) featuring Quantum Glass UI, live Karma stream, and Synapse Resonance Graph.
- **LLM Hybrid Architecture (Pattern B)**: Front-end uses Gemini Cloud (`gemini-2.5-flash`), background tasks use Ollama Local (`qwen3.5:9b`).
- **AI Name Customization**: Users can set a custom AI name during onboarding and change it later via Settings.
- **Onboarding Wizard v2**: 4-step onboarding (Welcome → Name → Avatar → Security) with avatar selection (gender + style).
- **Background LLM Settings UI**: Added Background LLM configuration section to Settings page.
- **IME Input Fix**: Fixed Japanese IME input clearing bug in Agent Console and Settings.

### Changed
- Background worker interval increased from 60s to 300s for Ollama stability.
- System prompt now dynamically injects AI name from DB settings.
- `build_system_instructions()` prioritizes `SOUL.md` content over hardcoded identity.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Full OSS Strategy**: Pivoted from Open-Core to a Full Open Source foundation under the Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2).
- **Aiome Branding**: Applied new visual identity including "Abstract Eye" logo and "Lobster Pilot" mascot.
- **Bilingual Documentation**: Established bilingual (EN/JP) versions for CLA, Code of Conduct, and Security Policy.
- **Governance Setup**: Implemented License Grant style CLA to encourage community contributions while protecting commercial rights.
- **Samsara Hub**: Central validator/quarantine node for federated learning and collective immunity.
- **Immune System**: Adaptive defense mechanism against malicious prompts and system anomalies.
- **Dream State**: Background generation of creative concepts and visual experiments.
- **Skill Arena**: Automated A/B testing framework for evaluating LLM prompts and styles.
- **Oracle**: Multi-model consensus system for scoring and validating generated media.
- **Resilience**: Jitter, Circuit Breaker, and HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) for federation sync and API calls.
- **Watchtower (Discord)**: Persona-driven interaction with rich stats (Resonance, Tech Lv) and evolution tracking.
- **Safety**: Structured JSON logging, `cargo audit` integration, and `cargo deny` license auditing.
- **Self-Healing**: Automated memory distillation, DB scavenging, and karma pruning.

### Changed
- Migrated federation endpoints to versioned API (`/api/v1/`).
- Enhanced `api-server` structured logging for observability.
