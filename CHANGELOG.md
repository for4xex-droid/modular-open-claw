## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Context Management System (4-Layer Guardrails)**: Implemented an autonomous guardrail system to prevent AI agent contextual collapse and cascade errors. Includes `.context/RIPPLE_MAP.md` for deterministic dependency tracking, `preflight` workflow commands, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs `001` through `007`), and rigorous documentation synchronization rules.
- **Comprehensive Documentation Update**: Replaced 254 instances of "自動補完" (placeholder) documentation with context-aware, inferred descriptions across 47 Rust files. Resolved all `missing_documentation` warnings workspace-wide.
- **Preserve Intent Policy**: Established a workspace-wide policy (ADR 007) to suppress unused code/import warnings via `#[allow(...)]` instead of deletion, preserving developer context and intent for future features. Updated CI and all crate roots (`shared`, `infrastructure`, `soul`, `core`, `api-server`, `watchtower`) to enforce this policy.
- **Soul Engine (Phase 4 - Autonomic Deepening)**:
    - **Step 0 (Soul Memory)**: Added `SoulSnapshot` cache to `SqliteSoulStore` mapping memory to the chat LLM via `build_system_instructions`, eliminating DB latency on hot paths.
    - **Step 1 (Attachment Transitions)**: Implemented dynamics for `AttachmentStyle` shifting (Secure/Anxious/Avoidant/Disorganized) based on positive/negative interaction valences.
    - **Step 2 (Compound Triggers)**: Added true evaluation logic for `DefenseTrigger::Compound` in the internal `SoulPipeline`.
    - **Step 3 & 4 (Somatic Resonance & Reflex)**: Integrated Somatic Bias into predictions (incorporating intuitive emotion) and implemented fallback reflex defense generation for heavily negative experiences.
    - **Step 5 & 6 (Physical Execution & Temporal Decay)**: Mapped `RequireEscrow`, `Deflect`, and `Custom` defense actions to `Evolution Chronicle` audit trails, and added temporal intensity decay (death threshold 0.2) to prevent memory saturation over infinite rebirth cycles.
    - **Step 7 (Observability API)**: Added `GET /api/soul/status` to expose real-time internal state metrics (attachment style, active defenses count, soul resonance avg).
- **Soul Engine (Phase 3 - Reactive Hardening)**: 
    - **Step 1 (R-2)**: Improved `SoulError` granularity with context-aware prefixes (`[SoulDistill]`, `[SoulAdapter]`, etc.) for better debugging.
    - **Step 2 (Immune Feedback)**: Integrated `ImmuneSystem` threat detection into the `SoulPipeline` as negative experiences (`security.immune_response`), allowing the AI to learn from neutralized attacks.
    - **Step 3 (Somatic Marking)**: Enabled automatic generation of `SomaticMarker` (emotional grounding) during experience processing for all experiences with valence > 0.3 or < -0.3.
    - **Step 4 (Physical Defense)**: Connected `execute_defense` to physical actions: `DefenseAction::Reject` now dynamically injects `ImmuneRule`s, `Warn` records to the `Evolution Chronicle`, and `Hesitate` injects adaptive latency.
    - **Step 5 (Semantic Defense)**: Upgraded `SoulPipeline` to pre-fetch text embeddings asynchronously, enabling `DefenseTrigger::Semantic` cosine similarity matching while preventing redundant API calls (DS-1/RTT=0 optimization).
    - **Step 6 (Anamnesis Profile)**: Integrated `AnamnesisProfile` into `AgentSoul` and persistent storage, allowing narrative identity and maladaptive schemas to persist across generations via the `SamsaraEngine` rebirth cycle.
- **Soul Engine (Phase 1)**: Initial implementation of the Three-Layer Soul Architecture. Added `libs/soul` crate containing `AgentSoul` (Core), `PredictiveModel` (L2/Plasticity), `SomaticMarker` (L1/Reactive), and `Instinct` (L3/Meta-cognitive).
- **Soul Persistence**: Implemented `SqliteSoulStore` in `libs/infrastructure` for persisting and loading `AgentSoul` state, including a 10,000-entry experience buffer limit to prevent storage bloat.
- **Federated Soul Metadata**: Extended `FederatedKarma` and `approved_karma` schema to include `generation` and `somatic_valence`, enabling cross-node learning of personality traits.
- **AgentRx Framework Integration**: Implemented a comprehensive agentic diagnostic and recovery system including `TrajectoryStore` (SQLite), `ConstraintChecker` (rule-based validation), and `AgentRxDiagnostics` (LLM-based self-review). Added full integration into `skill_handler.rs` and the main chat loop for autonomous failure recovery.
- **WASM `fs_reader` Security Fix (P0)**: Corrected a path traversal vulnerability in the `fs_reader` WASM skill by replacing string-based prefix checks with component-aware `Path::starts_with`.
- **Enhanced BastionGuard Whitelisting & Flag Validation**: Strengthened `safe_exec` to recursively validate paths within command-line flags (e.g., `--file=path`) and explicitly blacklisted access to sensitive internal files like `.env`, `.git`, and `security.json` even within the allowed workspace.
- **AgentRx Schema Migration**: Added `trajectory_steps` and `agent_diagnoses` tables to the core database to enable persistent storage of agent execution paths and recovery hints.
- **Security Whitelist Optimization**: Removed `mv` from the default `BastionGuard` whitelist to prevent uncontrolled file movement and maintain consistency with other restricted destructive commands.
- **FTS5 Synchronization Triggers**: Implemented robust error handling for Search Index (FTS5) triggers in `migrations.rs`, replacing silent ignores with structured warnings and idempotent creation checks.
- **Duplicate Safety Directive Removal**: Cleaned up code across `infrastructure` and `core` crates by removing redundant `![forbid(unsafe_code)]` attributes.
- **Soul Engine Pipeline Integration (Phase 1.5)**: Implemented `DefaultSamsaraEngine` and `CoreDomainAdapter`, and integrated `SoulPipeline` and `SqliteSoulStore` directly into the `api-server` background worker loop for cyclic experience processing.
- **Experience Buffer Bounding**: Implemented `push_experience` to enforce a 1000-item memory limit on `experience_buffer` to prevent Out-Of-Memory issues during active sessions.
- **Soul Engine LLM Distillation (Phase 2)**: Core Samsara Engine now strictly limits distillation token context (`R-5`) and natively uses the LLM via `provider.complete` to generate real `InstinctRules` from recent experiences, replacing the static Phase 1 mock.
- **Soul Architecture Integration (Phase 2b)**: Unified `DreamState` (L0 Contemplation) and `SamsaraEvent::LevelUp` (L0 Progression) direct into `SoulPipeline` (L2/L3) converting environmental and introspective triggers into dynamic `Experience` objects safely decoupled from the heartbeat pattern (`R-6`).
- **Predictive Grounding**: Enabled actual `predict_outcome` capabilities inside the `CoreDomainAdapter`, activating `PredictiveModel` prediction accuracy calculations across arbitrary domains and enabling true surprise mechanics (`R-1`).
### Fixed
- **Soul Engine Robustness**: Resolved 16 issues discovered during deep scans, including `AgentSoul` ID validation, `compute_hash` logic for state integrity, safety attributes, and error conversion between `SoulError` and `AiomeError`.
- **Samsara Hub Data Integrity**: Fixed missing columns in `samsara-hub` SELECT/INSERT operations to ensure `generation` and `somatic_valence` are properly synchronized across the federation.
- **SQLite Deadlock in Swarm Ops (Critical)**: Resolved a deadlock in `do_sign_swarm_payload` where recursive calls to `do_get_node_id` created nested SQLite transactions, hitting the single-writer constraint and causing 8 karma tests to hang indefinitely. Refactored to a linear flow: ensure keys exist first, then sign without recursion.
- **Stack Overflow in JobQueue Trait Methods**: Applied `Box::pin` to all 55 delegation methods in `impl JobQueue for SqliteJobQueue` to heap-allocate async futures, preventing the 60+ method async state machine from overflowing the thread stack.
- **SwarmOps Direct Call Pattern**: Replaced `JobQueue` trait method calls (`get_node_id`, `tick_local_clock`, `sign_swarm_payload`) with direct `SwarmOps::do_*` calls in `guardrails.rs` and `karma.rs` to avoid pulling in the entire trait's massive async future.
- **Test Thread Stack Size**: Added `.cargo/config.toml` with `RUST_MIN_STACK=64MB` to ensure sufficient stack space for debug-build async futures.
- **Repository Hygiene**: Removed `check_output.txt` from the repository and added it to `.gitignore`.
- **Dream State JSON Injection (A-9)**: Replaced `format!`-based JSON construction with `serde_json::json!` macro in `dream_state.rs` to prevent JSON injection through unsanitized strings.

### Changed
- **Panic-Free Startup**: Replaced all `expect()` / `unwrap()` calls in `api-server/main.rs` startup path with `unwrap_or_else` + `error!` + `std::process::exit(1)` for graceful error reporting.
- **Guardrail Test Safety (B6)**: Removed unsafe and redundant `std::env::set_var` calls from `guardrails.rs` unit tests, relying on the secure default of `true` for `ENFORCE_GUARDRAIL`.
- **API Server Secret in Tests**: Updated `api_integration_tests.rs` to pass secrets via type-safe `AppState` instead of environment variables, aligning with the new centralized secret management.
- **CORS Configuration**: Migrated from hardcoded origin strings to `AiomeConfig.allowed_origins`, loaded dynamically from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var.
- **Hub URL Resolution**: `SAMSARA_HUB_REST` and `SAMSARA_HUB_WS` now resolved from `AiomeConfig` instead of scattered `env::var()` calls.
- **Federation Secret**: `FEDERATION_SECRET` no longer panics when unset; instead logs a warning and defaults to empty string.
- **DB Migration Logging**: Replaced silent `.ok()` error suppression in `migrations.rs` with `info!` logging for index creation and ALTER TABLE operations.
- **Server Bind Error**: TCP listener bind failure now shows the actual address and exits gracefully instead of panicking.
- **API Server Modularization**: Extracted massive monolithic routing into `routes/` (karma, agent, biome, expression, general) to prepare for Biome integration.
- **Samsara Engine (Evolution)**: AI self-leveling based on cumulative Technical Karma weights (`do_sync_samsara_level`).
- **Meta-Control Security**: Introduced `ConstitutionalValidator` trait for Heterogeneous Dual-LLM validation. The `SoulMutator` now securely verifies `SOUL.md` mutations using a prosecutor LLM.
- **Management Console (Dashboard v2)**: Launched a Tauri React-based desktop shell (`apps/management-console`) featuring Quantum Glass UI, live Karma stream, and Synapse Resonance Graph.
- **LLM Hybrid Architecture (Pattern B)**: Front-end uses Gemini Cloud (`gemini-2.5-flash`), background tasks use Ollama Local (`qwen3.5:9b`).
- **AI Name Customization**: Users can set a custom AI name during onboarding and change it later via Settings.
- **Onboarding Wizard v2**: 4-step onboarding (Welcome → Name → Avatar → Security) with avatar selection (gender + style).
- **Background LLM Settings UI**: Added Background LLM configuration section to Settings page.
- **IME Input Fix**: Fixed Japanese IME input clearing bug in Agent Console and Settings.

### Changed
- Background worker interval increased from 60s to 300s for Ollama stability.
- System prompt now dynamically injects AI name from DB settings.
- `build_system_instructions()` prioritizes `SOUL.md` content over hardcoded identity.
